### Issues Fixed

1. **Casting Process Validation**: Added validation for numeric fields in the staff route for updating casting process. Now properly rejects invalid data types like "not-a-number" for numeric fields.
2. **Polish Process Validation**: Added validation for numeric and date fields in the staff route for updating polish process.
3. **Turning Process Validation**: Added validation for numeric and date fields in the staff route for updating turning process.
4. **Raw Materials Validation**: Enhanced validation for numeric fields (quantity and totalPrice) in the raw materials route.

### Recommendations

1. Consider implementing a middleware for data validation across all routes to avoid duplicating validation logic.
2. Add comprehensive unit tests for all validation scenarios.
3. Implement consistent error handling patterns across the application.
